/**
 * API Proxy for Invite Consumption
 * This is a simple proxy to handle CORS and call the Firebase function
 * In production, this would be handled by your backend or Firebase Functions directly
 */

// This is a placeholder - in a real implementation, you would:
// 1. Deploy this as a Firebase Function
// 2. Or set up a proper backend API
// 3. Or configure CORS properly on the Firebase Function

// For now, this file serves as documentation of what the API should do
console.log('Invite consumption API proxy - this would call the Firebase function in production');

// The actual implementation would be in your Firebase Functions
// and would handle the token validation and user creation
