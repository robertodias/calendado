# ADR-003: Monitoring Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As the Calendado application grows, we need comprehensive monitoring to:
- Detect issues before they impact users
- Understand system performance
- Track business metrics
- Debug production issues
- Ensure service reliability

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered monitoring strategy:

1. **Firebase Performance Monitoring** for basic metrics
2. **Custom monitoring service** for business-specific metrics
3. **Structured logging** with consistent format
4. **Health check endpoints** for service discovery
5. **Circuit breakers** for external service reliability

## Implementation
- Custom MonitoringService class for metrics collection
- Performance tracking decorators
- Structured JSON logging
- Health check endpoints (/health, /ready, /live)
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services

## Metrics to Track
- **Business metrics**: Waitlist signups, email delivery rates
- **Performance metrics**: Function execution time, memory usage
- **Error metrics**: Error rates by category, retry success
- **System metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage

## Consequences
### Positive
- Proactive issue detection
- Better system understanding
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Service reliability insights
- Business intelligence

### Negative
- Additional code complexity
- Storage costs for metrics
- Learning curve for team
- Potential performance overhead

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Third-party APM**: Expensive, less control
2. **Basic logging only**: Insufficient for production
3. **Cloud monitoring only**: Limited business context

## Monitoring
- Track monitoring overhead
- Monitor alert fatigue
- Regular metric review
- Cost optimization
